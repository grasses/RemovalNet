# RemovalNet

This repository is the official implementation of paper: **"RemovalNet: DNN model fingerprinting removal attack"**.
The RemovalNet is a min-max bi-level optimization-based DNN fingerprint removal attack that is used to *delete fingerprint-specific knowledge* while *maintaining general semantic knowledge* of the target model.

# Running!
Example command for model "train(vgg19_bn,CIFAR10)-":
```shell
python -m attack.RemovalNet.removalnet -model1 "train(vgg19_bn,CIFAR10)-" -subset CIFAR10 -subset_ratio 1.0 -layer 2 -batch_size 128 -device 0 -tag ''
```

Please note, put target model in path: model/ckpt/train(vgg19_bn,CIFAR10)-/final_ckpt_s1000.pth !!
