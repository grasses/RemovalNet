# RemovalNet

This repository is the official implementation of paper: **"RemovalNet: DNN model fingerprinting removal attack"**.
The RemovalNet is a min-max bi-level optimization-based DNN fingerprint removal attack that is used to *delete fingerprint-specific knowledge* while *maintaining general semantic knowledge* of the target model.
